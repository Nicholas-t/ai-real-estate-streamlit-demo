-No big function parties  At ALL you will be kicked out with no refunds . Please respect space.

I really mean it when I say it’s for chill events. I don’t want no drama in my space, no fights, no turnt crowds, no over capacity. Please respect the space. IF YOU KNOW YOUR CROWD GETS Like this PLEASE DO NOT BOOK. Chill vibes only.  



SECURITY: 
If you have an event you must have security or a trusted family/friend member .If it's a small crowd not a problem but if it's a big crowd (more than 50) If you don’t have security to control your crowd please do not book. You will have to show proof of your security day of your event to worker. You need one to operate downstairs at all times to move crowd upstairs. No one is allowed to chill downstairs.

SETTING UP:
-You have to pay for your set up time. There will be no drop offs or setting up before the time you booked.  THE TIME YOU BOOK  is the time you can do your drop offs, setting up, ect.



CLEANING UP: 
- YOUR CLEAN UP TIME is considered your booking hours. If you are cleaning up after that it is still time that is going to be charged so if you feel like you need more time to clean up then book additional time or do the trash fee add on. You will be charged day of if you go over. Reason is host is waiting for clean up and has to stay longer. 

When cleaning up please take everything with you. It's not my responsibility to hold things for you. Anything that is left will be thrown away. People so far have made a habit of leaving things and trying to get it next morning. I have top clean  and do a lot of tours plus an event might take place after so I have to clean. TAKE EVERYTHING WITH YOU. 

ADDITIONAL CHARGES: 
-Damages /throw up 
-If there’s trash downstairs and a mess you will be charged extra depending on how much 
-Cleaning fee now depends on how you leave the place. If it’s simple trash to where it’s an easy clean up then you will be charged regular price. If the place is trashed up then cleaning is an additional charge. Which turns into $125 now. 
-More than the people you say you are bringing. If it over reaches capacity you will be charged. More than 60 guest is a charge. 

Cancellations Policy: 
-Due to events blocking more time out (meaning I am also blocking upstairs bookings from happening ) events are not as flexible from canceling . So you have 7 days to cancel an events and if you try to cancel when it comes close then it's a 50% refund. 

Frequently asked questions:
1) Is there a noise limit?
-No, having a DJ is okay. Loud music is fine. Just not those super Bassy Djs or those super big event dj were music is super loud to the max. 
2) Am I allowed to smoke and drink?
- Yes, papers would need to be signed day of stating that I am not responsible for you and your guest. I understand that some events have drinking and smoking. I don’t want CIGARETTES inside. Please do that outside  the building. Cigarettes are hard to get rid of. 
3) What is the limit of people? 
-The most people in space would be 75 max. I never had an event with more than that. Just depends what you are doing then I might take things into consideration. Just message me what type of event it will be and if security will be involved. Security is a must if you don’t have security do not book. You need one at all times operating downstairs because no one is allowed to chill. If you can’t control your crowd you will be asked to leave. 
4)Can I come view the space?
-Yes, but please message me day of to see what a good time to come in because People rent downstairs portion usually a day before.
