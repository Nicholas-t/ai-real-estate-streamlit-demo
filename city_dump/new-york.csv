The Classroom itself measures roughly 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 8 feet high. Its shape is a square with one small corner omitted.

The Classroom was most likely formerly used as a Sunday School classroom, as its located underneath a church. On one wall is a chalkboard, always stocked with new white and colored chalk and an eraser. Feel free to erase and draw your own creations. Two of the walls are beautifully aged with revealed bricks peeking out beneath a retro blue paint job. The floor is combination of black tiles and basement concrete. The ceiling is composed of tiled tin and exposed pipes. There's a door leading to the backyard. We've outfitted the Classroom with 12 school desks, a teacher's desk with a globe, and a shelf with school books.

Four windows let in a significant amount of daylight. Six fluorescent ceiling lights fill the room with bright light, or you can keep them off and let the photography lights do the illuminating.

The Back Hall features our TV Wall at one end of it. The hall is roughly 150 square feet, measuring 27 feet long by 8 feet wide and 7 feet high, with height variances.

At the end of the hall is our Clock Staircase, lined from bottom to top with various clocks while paper umbrellas hang from the ceiling. The Clock Staircase is 30 square feet, measuring 3 feet wide by 10 feet long.

Branching off the hall is the Safe Room. As an add-on, the safe room can be filled with money like the photograph. By default, it comes with the box safe and empty shelves only. The Safe Room is 18 square feet, measuring 3 feet wide by 6 feet long.

Across from the Safe Room is Under The Stairs, which is also 18 square feet, measuring 3 ft x 6 ft. This closet has a claustrophobic cellar-esque look.

The Backyard is roughly 600 square feet, measuring 45 feet long and 13.5 feet wide, its shape curving slightly. String lights add beauty and mood after sunset. Our new wooden fence serves as a beautiful backdrop. Outdoor installations like our antique furnaces, antique furniture, and bathtub give character to the environment. 
 
The Hall of Lamps is a 210 square foot aged basement hallway. The hallway is filled with a forest of floor lamps, which you can arrange or hide as you see fit. Numerous ceiling lamps hang above, which are controlled by a dimmer. Furnishings include a love seat and a bed that can glow green underneath. Turkish rugs hang from the walls. All the floor lamps and the bed can be moved to any room that you prefer.

The TV wall is made of 21 TVs. Most of the TVs can feature your custom video or still image. This image is transmitted via our laptop, which is connected to our wifi network. If you have no image in mind, the TVs can display static.

The Classroom is equipped with a 15,000 BTU Frigidaire window air conditioner to keep you cool in the summer and a 10000W Dr. Heater to keep you cozy all winter.

The Clock Stairway, Back Hall, and Hall of Lamps are equipped with a total of 17 Phillips Hue bulbs, which can be modified to any color or warm or cool white light, along with a range of brightness levels. The space is provided at our default colors in the photos, and for an additional fee, you may rent a tablet which controls the bulb settings. You're also welcome to rent our additional lighting gear if you'd like a brightness that goes beyond the capability of the Phillips bulbs.

Each of the four rooms, including the backyard, is equipped with three prong 110V electrical outlets powered by 20 amp circuits.

The space is equipped with a powerful WIFI network. 

All renters are able to rent our video projector and project it onto the wall. Use of this equipment costs an additional fee. 

Renters are able to safely store their equipment in the space overnight. 

Depending on the availability of our staff, renters are able to be in the space 24 hours, 7 days a week, with the exception of Sundays, 9am to 3:30pm, when we are closed.

There is bathroom access.

We regret that at this time, our space does not offer wheelchair access. We’ve spent the last year restoring this basement from the 1800s, but we are not yet at the point where we can afford to build ramps or elevators. With the help of your rentals, our budget will get there. Thank you for your patience.

Our space is more popular on Saturdays, and so you will notice that our hourly rate on Saturday is higher. This difference is intentional. Prices are also slightly higher on weekday evenings than weekdays during the day.

1339,32371,1,,1000.0,20000.0,1700.0,6000.0,False,,,Raw Historic Surreal Locker Room,"The locker room is a 1030 square foot historic set of 8 rooms available for film and photo shoots.

The rooms, located beneath a church, were abandoned in the 1970s. From October 2018 through April 2019, the space was renovated and is now available for your use. Thus, the look of the space is raw and industrial. Most of the floors are concrete. The bathroom and shower room are tiled. Many of the walls have flaking paint jobs and weathered areas. There's exposed piping, wood beams, and unique materials and textures everywhere.

The Shower Room has four brutal, beautiful vintage black shower stalls with working water spouts. 

The front door has a speakeasy style password window, which can be a fun set piece for certain shoots and events.

The space lets in very little daylight. The main doorway to the space can let in daylight, if left open. This allows photo and video work to have total control over the lighting. 

The space is equipped with a 12,000 BTU Fujitsu wall AC unit to keep you cool in the summer. We have two 5600W Dr. Infrared DR-988 space heaters to keep you warm in the winter. Our wall AC unit also acts as a heater.

There are newly installed power outlets in every room, each with two three-prong 110 volt sockets. 

The rooms are equipped with a total of 15 Phillips Hue bulbs, which can be modified to any color or warm or cool white light, along with a range of brightness levels. The space is provided at our default colors in the photos, and for an additional fee, you may rent a tablet which controls the bulb settings. You're also welcome to rent our additional lighting gear if you'd like a brightness that goes beyond the capability of the Phillips bulbs. 

The space is equipped with a powerful WIFI network. 

The space is highly set designed. Please be careful with our set and props. Some items, like the mannequins and the waiting room desks, can be moved without too much trouble. Many of the other decorations, such as the vines and the balloon tent, are embedded in the room and cannot be taken down or moved. 

Renters are able to safely store their equipment in the space overnight. The space is open from 3:30pm to midnight on Sundays, and from 4am to midnight on the other six days of the week.

Our venue has a large selection of in-house photo and video gear. For additional add-on fees, renters may use our lights, fog machines, speakers, and more. See our add-ons to learn more.

We regret that at this time, our space does not offer wheelchair access. We’ve spent the last year restoring this basement from the 1800s, but we are not yet at the point where we can afford to build ramps or elevators. With the help of your rentals, our budget will get there. Thank you for your patience.

Our space is more popular during evenings and weekends, and so you will notice that our hourly rate varies. Weekday evenings are priced higher after 6pm. Friday evening and all of Saturday and Sunday are priced at a premium.

But what if I told you that there's a single-family home located in Jamaica Estates, Queens, that transcends the usual definition of home? It doesn’t just provide comfort, it offers an experience - an intriguing blend of history, gourmet experiences, and immersive entertainment. 

This home sits across from the birthplace of the former US President, Donald Trump, giving it an aura of history and significance. But within its walls, it's a different story altogether. Here, it's about savouring the moment, and indulging in the delicacies of life. This kitchen is not just about preparing meals, but rather it's a stage for your BBQ culinary adventures. Lobster grilled to perfection, BBQ chicken wings seared with finesse, and tender ribs slow-cooked to fall-off-the-bone tenderness - it's a gastronomic journey.

But this house isn't just about indulgence. It's also about productive work and creativity. Imagine hosting an off-site business retreat in the comfort of this home. It's a space that can be transformed into a conducive work environment, where ideas are born and problems are solved. And after a day of brainstorming and strategizing, what better way to unwind than to enjoy the karaoke space, a lighthearted source of entertainment for you and your colleagues.

When it's time for relaxation, a large screen and projector setup provide a visual experience like no other. Whether you're watching a film, catching a sports event, or sharing a presentation, the experience is immersive. The spacious living area is a hub for shared experiences and memories, a testament to the beauty of communal living.

Adding to the charm of the property is the beautifully curated garden. It's not just a garden; it's an oasis of tranquility, a retreat for reflection, and a backdrop for socializing. This garden, like the house itself, defies conventional definitions.

The house accommodates a party of up to 20 people. It's not merely about providing space, but about fostering connections and creating experiences. It's a reminder that a home is not just a place to live, but a place to thrive.""",,Jamaica,Queens,11432,Event Space,,Air Conditioning;Furniture;Electricity;Fitting Rooms;Heating;Kitchen;Lighting;Security System;Street Level;Internet;Sound & Video Equipment;Toilets;Living Space;Bathroom;Bar;Daylight;Garden;Private Parking;Large Door Entrance;Multiple Rooms;Water Access;Smoking Area;Soundproof,Product Launch;Food Event;Corporate Event;Photoshoot & Filming;Conference;Food & Beverage;Meeting;Office;Photo Shooting,new-york

1972,32370,1,,1000.0,35000.0,1700.0,10000.0,False,,,Raw Historic Underground Gymnasium,"This is a 2500 square foot gymnasium available for video shoots, photo shoots, and events. The space also comes with an adjacent 72 square foot ramp that makes for a cool side room.

The gym measures 50 feet long, 50 feet wide, and 13.5 feet high.

The gymnasium, located beneath a church, was abandoned in the 1970s. From October 2018 through April 2019, the space was renovated and is now available for your use. Thus, the look of the space is raw and industrial, including a retro paint job, a wall of brick, old basketball hoops, and a tiled tin ceiling. The floor is the original concrete, currently not finished, with small pocks and unevenness throughout.

The space lets in very little daylight. Even at high noon on a bright day, there is almost total darkness in the gym. This allows photo and video work to have total control over the lighting.

The gym is equipped with a 5 ton central heating and cooling system, newly installed in 2020, to keep you chill all summer and cozy all winter, and to allow good air circulation.

There are six electricity outlets in the gym, some with one socket, and some with as many as four sockets. One of these six outlets is a 220 volt outlet while the other five outlets support 110 volts. The circuits range from 20 amps to 30 amps.

The two center columns of the Gym are equipped with eight 3000 lumen bright white LED light bulbs for maximum visibility.

The side columns of the Gym are equipped with 7 Phillips Hue bulbs, which can be modified to any color or warm or cool white light, along with a range of brightness levels. The Gymnasium is provided at our default lighting in the photos, and for an additional fee, you may rent a tablet which controls the bulb settings. The 7 Phillips Hue bulbs are not bright enough to fill up the entire room with bright saturated colored light, but it's great ambient lighting for live events, or to compliment the lighting in your photo or video shoot. The rentable tablet also controls the color of the lamp in the Ramp side room. You're also welcome to rent our additional lighting gear to provide the quality of light that you need.

The space is equipped with a powerful WIFI network. 

Renters are able to rent our collapsable movie screen and projector to stage their own film viewings. Our movie screen is approximately 22 feet by 12.5 feet. Our projector is a Panasonic VZ-580. Use of this equipment costs an additional fee.

Renters are able to safely store their equipment in the space overnight. Renters are able to be in the space 24 hours a day, with the exception of Sundays, when we are closed between 7am and 3:30pm.

The venue has a seating capacity of 50. Please notify in advance so that the correct number of chairs can be set in place. If you need more than 10 chairs, the venue will ask a furniture fee. Additional tables are also available for a fee. If you'd like to bring in additional seats, more will fit in the space.

Our venue has a large selection of in-house photo and video gear. For additional add-on fees, renters may use our lights, fog machines, speakers, and more. Please see our add-ons to see the entire selection.

We are picky when it comes to booking events at our space, and say no to the majority of the requests we get, which are for parties and concerts. That said, we do love the events we host here that are right for our church basement. We favor small gatherings with a mellow daytime energy. A screening of your new short film could work great here. A dinner party for a small group of friends could be a great fit.

Also note that while some art exhibitions are occasionally a good fit for our space, we do not host most pop-ups, as they tend to not work well with the multiple spaces in our property.

We regret that at this time, our space does not offer wheelchair access. We’ve spent the last year restoring this basement from the 1800s, but we are not yet at the point where we can afford to build ramps or elevators. With the help of your rentals, our budget will get there. Thank you for your patience.

Our space is more popular during evenings and weekends, and so you will notice that our hourly rate varies. Weekday evenings are priced higher after 6pm. Friday evening and all of Saturday and Sunday are priced at a premium.

Discovery, wonder, and the unexpected are big themes... Handmade mosaic murals tell stories of underground creatures. There are moving walls and secret doors. The plants are an idealized woodland, dressed-up cousins of what might have grown along the edges of fields and farms past. Birds, bees and butterflies are invited back. The buildings “breathe” with automated natural ventilation. Fountains and water features collect and recycle stormwater for irrigation. A decade of design and construction led to a complex and interwoven series of architectural ideas that coalesced into a rare and unexpected nature retreat in New York City.

Available Spaces at Carroll Hall:

The Garden
The garden is the heart of Carroll Hall, designed with the promise of a quiet moment outside. A vibrant mix of perennials with flowering interest throughout the growing seasons embrace its two connected courtyards. Here you’ll find a magnolia tree and camellias, golden grasses, smoke bush and chartreuse vines, evergreens, purple allium, ferns, and soft mossy carpets, plus plenty of happy bumbling bees and birds. Reclaimed water from the site is stored in a large underground tank and used to irrigate the garden. ADA accessible.
